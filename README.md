Supercolony
========

Daily generative art works by [Tim Rolls](http://timrolls.com).

Visit our [Tumblr](http://supercolony.co) for images and videos generated from these sketches.

Every sketch we've generated using [Processing](http://processing.org) is available on this repo. Many sketches use the [HYPE framework](hypeframework.org), and some use external libraries like [Hemesh](http://hemesh.wblut.com/).
Some also use Leap Motion for gestural control.

Some of the Vector files ended up being too large for Github, so they had to be removed. 

The code is messy, has lots of commented chunks, and is meant as a learning reference.
If you use this code, I'd love to see what you do with it.
