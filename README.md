Supercolony
========

Daily generative art works by [Tim Rolls](http://timrolls.com).

Visit our [Tumblr](http://supercolony.co) for images and videos generated from these sketches.

Every sketch we've generated using [Processing](http://processing.org) is available on this repo. Many sketches use the [HYPE framework](hypeframework.org), and some use external libraries like [Hemesh](http://hemesh.wblut.com/).
Some also use Leap Motion for gestural control.

The code is messy, has lots of commented chunks, and is meant as a learning reference.
If you use this code, I'd love to see what you do with it.
