PixelDrifter is the powerful pixel-sorting tool written in pure Java. Make sure you have
JDK/JRE(6 or higher) installed on your machine and your desktop environment is
properly set up. Unlike many other pixel-sorting applications, PixelDrifter is the work
of digital art - the true successor of Conway's Game of Life.

The freeware version of PixelDrifter comes with no warranty, no user-guide and no user
support. Also several modes are locked. Other limitations of the demo version:
only 5 passes in a row allowed, watermark.

Some hints:

Sometimes for some reason the Java virtual machine ignores Window.pack() method
which ends up with the PxDrifter window refusing to resize to fit an image size. Use
"Options->Repack Window" to forcibly restore the correct window dimensions.

The realtime visualization, especially of a scaled down image, significantly slows down 
the sorting process. Disable this option while working with huge images unless you got a
really fast  machine.

Normally, if you try to load an image which is to huge to fit your computer's memory
you get an error message. Although, some out of memory errors may remain uncaught.
If you try do do something, but nothing happens - that's most likely the OOM error. Try
increasing java heap size. 

"Save frames" option will reliably work only with "slower" algorithms.
